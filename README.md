# DEVMOUNTAIN ASYNC Study Repo

This repo is designed for you to find useful study materials in topics that you feel you need extra help. If you find any resources that are helpful to you and not on this list, please make a pull request to add them. 
There is also a super handy site created by DVMTN students for DVMTN students:

To add something to a table in a readme.md file, please follow this styling:
```
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
```

There must be a minimum of three dashes to separate the headers.
