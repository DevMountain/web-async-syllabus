# DEVMOUNTAIN ASYNC Study Repo
<br>
<br>

### Purpose
<hr>
This repo is designed for you to find useful study materials in topics that you feel you need extra help. If you find any resources that are helpful to you and not on this list, 
please make a pull request to add them. 
There is also a super handy site created by DVMTN students for DVMTN students: <a target="_blank" href="http://resources.devmountain.com/#/">DevMountainResources</a>

DevMountain is committed to providing you the best education possible. For some people that means being in a lecture/project setting, and for others, that means giving them all the 
tools they need to study on their own. The ASYNC program at DevMountain was created to help you study at your own pace. You will have full access to the resources and materials available to any DevMountain student, 
including vimeo videos, mentor help and projects. In addition, this repo has been created for you to help you find great resources for topics that you would like to learn. 

We feel like you will benefit more from the latter, and have created this program to make sure you have the opportunity to learn as much as 
you want to, at your own pace.

Make sure you have joined the web-async-provo slack channel, as important information will be passed through from time to time.

There must be a minimum of three dashes to separate the headers from the other rows in the column.
Please use a url shortener like <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/">goo.gl</a> to help keep a clean code base.
